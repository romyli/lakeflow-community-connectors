# Document Source Write-Back API

## Description

This skill helps you research and document the write/create APIs for a source system to enable comprehensive write-back testing. This is an optional step that should only be done when you need end-to-end validation of write → read → incremental sync cycles. The documentation will be added as a separate section to your existing API documentation.

## Instructions
Read and follow **[prompts/document_write_back_api_of_source.md](../../../prompts/document_write_back_api_of_source.md)**
